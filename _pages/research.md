## Research
My main research interests untiel now have revolved around various fields of applied mathematics, and I am now orienting myself more towards **Machine Learning**.

## Current Work - Internship at INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France
I am currently pursuing a research internship at INRIA, at the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Optimal Transport. More precisely, my work focuses on generalizing entropic optimal transport to the broader class of f-divergence–regularized frameworks, with applications in machine learning. The first part of the internship concerns establishing theoretical guarantees, while the second part will focus on designing and implementing efficient algorithms for accelerated computation of Wasserstein distances.

## Three-semester PDE research project - MICS laboratory, CentraleSupélec, France
Research conducted under the supervision of Anna Rozanova-Pierrat, of the MICS laboratory. The research focused on the Stokes system for fluids in domains with potentially rough, typically fractal boundaries. The study established the well-posedness of the problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Further work explored theoretical properties of unusual Sobolev spaces. 

## PDE/Modeling project - CentraleSupélec, France
Work carried out under the joint supervision of Philippe Bouafia and Gabriel Velho. Modeled the growth of a spy network using a system of partial differential equations, established its well-posedness, and analyzed the influence of various parameters through numerical (finite elements) solutions.

## Transport and diffusion of a pollutant within an aquifer, Lycée International de Valbonne, France
Measured the coefficients of an existing PDE model through experiments. Developed a discrete numerical model based on the measured coefficients and conducted simulations.
