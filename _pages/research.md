## Research Interests

My main research interests lie at the intersection of **applied mathematics** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on:

- Optimal transport theory and its applications in data science  
- Statistical learning and information geometry  
- Partial differential equations and variational methods  
- Mathematical modeling in high-dimensional systems

## Current Work

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics** at *CentraleSupélec* (Université Paris-Saclay).  
My research and coursework revolve around the mathematical foundations of modern AI, particularly the links between **optimization**, **measure theory**, and **machine learning**.

## Future Directions

I am particularly interested in continuing to explore how **geometric and variational structures** can help us better understand modern ML algorithms — and, conversely, how data-driven methods can inspire new **computational approaches** in mathematical physics and applied analysis.
