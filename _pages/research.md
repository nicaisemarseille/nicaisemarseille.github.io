# Research Interests

My main research interests until now have revolved around various fields of **applied mathematics**.
---

## Current Work - Internship at INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France

I am currently pursuing a research internship at INRIA, at the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Optimal Transport. More precisely, my work focuses on generalizing entropic optimal transport to the broader class of f-divergence–regularized frameworks, with applications in machine learning. The first part of the internship concerns establishing theoretical guarantees, while the second part will focus on designing and implementing efficient algorithms for accelerated computation of Wasserstein distances.

## Three-semester PDE research project - MICS laboratory, CentraleSupélec, France
 Research conducted under the supervision of Anna Rozanova-Pierrat, of the MICS laboratory. The research focused on the Stokes system for fluids in domains with potentially rough, typically fractal boundaries. The study established the well-posedness of the problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Further work explored theoretical properties of the Sobolev space $\operatorname{\bf H}(\operatorname{\bf curl},\Omega)$ on such irregular domains. 
### ⚙️ *Entropy-regularized optimal transport for domain adaptation*
Exploring the use of entropy-regularized OT in semi-supervised learning problems.  
**Keywords:** Optimal transport, Sinkhorn algorithm, domain adaptation.

### 🧠 *Neural PDEs and physics-informed neural networks*
Modeling dynamical systems through PDE-informed deep learning architectures.  
**Keywords:** PDEs, variational principles, PINNs, numerical analysis.

### 📊 *Wasserstein distances for generative models*
Studying the theoretical properties and numerical behavior of Wasserstein losses in GAN-type models.  
**Keywords:** Optimal transport, generative modeling, convex optimization.

## Future Directions

I am particularly interested in continuing to explore how **geometric and variational structures** can help us better understand modern ML algorithms — and, conversely, how data-driven methods can inspire new **computational approaches** in mathematical physics and applied analysis.
