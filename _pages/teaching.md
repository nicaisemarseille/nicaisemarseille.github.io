Throughout my studies, I have had several opportunities to teach mathematics at the undergraduate level, both as a teaching assistant and through individual supervision.

## Teaching Assistant in Measure Theory, Probability, and Partial Differential Equations courses -  CentraleSupélec, France
<sub> I was involved, between September 2024 and February 2025, in the instruction of third-year undergraduate students at CentraleSupélec.  
My role included preparing and leading weekly 2-hour tutorials covering Measure Theory, Probability, and Partial Differential Equations.  
My responsibilities also involved creating lecture slides, designing exercises, and developing additional teaching materials to support student learning. </sub>

## Oral Examiner (“Colleur”) for Second Year of Classes Préparatoires - Lycée International de Valbonne, France
<sub> Along my internship at INRIA, I also serve as an oral examiner in second-year *Classes Préparatoires* (France’s selective two-year post-secondary programs preparing students for competitive entrance exams to top engineering schools), at Lycée International de Valbonne. My role consists of conducting weekly oral mathematics examinations (“colles”) with small groups of students, assessing their problem-solving skills, guiding them through advanced exercises, and providing detailed feedback on their reasoning and methods. </sub>
