I am Maxime, a graduate student in Applied Mathematics at CentraleSupélec (Université Paris-Saclay). I am passionate about mathematics in all its forms, and I am fascinated about the idea of theory meeting applications.

Beyond academics, I am an enthusiast of computer-made music production. I love experimenting with synthetic sounds, and I have been making such music since I was a child.

I also enjoy very much the practice of kickboxing. Whenever possible, I take part in competitions.
