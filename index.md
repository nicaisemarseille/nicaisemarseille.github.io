<sub> Welcome! <br> <br> My name is **Maxime Nicaise**, I am a MSc student in Applied Mathematics at *CentraleSupélec* (Université Paris-Saclay). My interests include *Optimal Transport*, *Machine Learning*, and *Statistics*. You can explore my work in the sections above. <br> <br> I am currently taking a gap year between the first and second year of my master studies to explore different professional environments. After a first research internship in France from September to February, at INRIA in *Optimal Transport*, I am now seeking a second internship in South-East Asia, this time in a company setting, to deepen my practical experience with *data* and *AI*, alongside my academic work.</sub>.
